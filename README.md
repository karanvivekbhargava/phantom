### Progress
This project was designed with a single programmer in mind. My Solo Iterative Process (SIP) logs are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zQw33HwWlc9W2n8Jv4OPqIg89_HEhfbk4SuXU9Ko2rA/edit?usp=sharing).

### Reference
This project is a direct implementation of the Hazel engine created by Cherno. All credits to him for creating such a well designed game series which lets a beginner programmer like me to play with it. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in game development in general.
